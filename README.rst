MinmlDB - A minimal noSQL Database written in Python
=====================================================

As it is an all-in-one solution, the tools used are rather opinionated. They include:

* Paver_ for running miscellaneous tasks
* Setuptools_ for distribution (Setuptools and Distribute_ have merged_)
* Sphinx_ for documentation
* flake8_ for source code checking
* pytest_ for unit testing
* mock_ for mocking (not required by the template, but included anyway)
* tox_ for testing on multiple Python versions

If you are new to Python or new to creating Python projects, see Kenneth Reitz's `Hitchhiker's Guide to Python`_ for an explanation of some of the tools used here.
